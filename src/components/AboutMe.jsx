      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I’m Rajasekhar Reddy — a highly driven IVR Engineer, Contact Center Architect, and Cloud Solutions Specialist with 13 years of hands-on experience designing, 
      engineering, and delivering enterprise-grade voice, telephony, and customer engagement platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
      My technical expertise spans end-to-end IVR engineering, including DTMF/ASR call flow design, SIP trunking, PSTN routing, CTI event handling, 
      and high-availability voice application deployment across Amazon Connect, Avaya Experience Portal, and Huawei IPCC ecosystems. I build IVR systems 
      that prioritize resiliency, low-latency call handling, and seamless omni-channel orchestration.
      </p>
      <p>
      I specialize in architecting cloud-native, event-driven contact center infrastructures leveraging AWS services such as Amazon COnnect, Lambda, DynamoDB, 
      API Gateway, S3, CloudWatch, Kinesis, Step Functions, Lex, and SNS/SQS. My implementations focus on scalable routing logic, microservice-driven call processing, 
      real-time analytics, and fault-tolerant automation patterns suited for global CX operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the integration side, I have engineered complex Service Cloud Voice, CRM, and REST API–driven interaction pipelines, enabling deep data synchronization 
        and context-rich agent experiences. My work includes designing secure authentication flows, API-gateway policies, and custom middleware for telephony-event 
        publishing and workflow automation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I excel in transforming legacy IVR stacks into modern cloud architectures by applying principles of distributed computing, SIP optimization, 
        observability engineering, and CI/CD-driven voice application deployment. My solutions are built with a focus on operational efficiency, reliability, 
        and measurable customer experience uplift.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every project I lead is driven by a passion for precision, system-level thinking, and building impactful voice solutions that bridge business goals 
        with advanced communication technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio—where innovation, telephony engineering, and cloud architecture converge.
